Co-Chef is a productivity tool for your kitchen.
When you have a good that you don't know what to do, Co-Chef guides you. For example, on main page click for the goods that you have and press filter button, Co-Chef shows you that recipes you can cook with that good.
MVP is working but there's just sample recipes and goods. It also contains registration component.

Missing parts:
- Starring recipes
- Add own recipe

I used React as MVC and Bootstrap for interface. I also used Node.js, Express.js, bcrypt and Postgre SQL.
